## About the Game

The goal of the game is to get more points within 3 minutes as a single player or a team than your opposition. You can get points by positioning shapes on top of Emojis in a way that covers up the whole current Emoji.

### Game Modes

There are 2 game modes in the game, that can be selected in the main menu.

* 2vs2: 4 players are divided in 2 groups, each group consists of 2 players. The groups compete against each other.
* 1vs1: 2 players compete against each other.

### Gameplay
Before the game begins, each player decides at which base he will play during the game. Each player should stay near his base during the game.
The game begins, after the countdown is over.
During the game the players can shoot the projectile, in order to catch stones and items. Then the projectile must be dragged back to the base, by rotating the wheel. After the projectile is back at it's initial position, the hooked stone/item can be used.
The stones are placed into the inventory.
From the inventory the stones can be placed on the emoji and in the workshop.
In the workshop the stone can be scaled and rotated. Afterwards the stone can be dragged away to emoji.
The players try to cover the emoji with stones. For stones, that are badly placed, negative points will be added.
In order to get points for the emoji coverage, the toggle button must be activated. In game mode "2vs2", both toggle buttons must be activated. After it, a new emoji is loaded.
If a player activates Defect Item, the opponent's cannon starts to burn and must be restored with a water droplet.
The game can be paused by touching the timer in the game field.
The game ends after 3 minutes, the players will be warned with a countdown before the end.
